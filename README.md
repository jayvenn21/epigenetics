In this project, I conducted an extensive analysis of various datasets to explore the relationships between variables like IQ and Human Development Index (HDI) with other various nutritional and epigenetic factors. The main purpose was to specifically see general global trends and focus on India's performance in nutrition and other metrics. The analysis is supported by more than 15 visualizations, including bar graphs, scatter plots, and pie charts.

Advanced statistical methods and machine learning techniques were employed to gain deeper insights. These methods included calculating correlation coefficients (r), coefficients of determination (rÂ²), and developing predictive models. These were done to allow for an intermediate statistical analysis to see correlation and outliers. In addition, some graphs forecast epigenetic trends for 2025, but generally have a particular focus on how nutrition impacts public health in India.

Data-driven insights were synthesized within Jupyter Notebook using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and numpy. The project also examined the effects of environmental factors like pollution and UV radiation, as well as socio-economic influences on epigenetic outcomes. The findings offer actionable public health strategies based on the analysis.
